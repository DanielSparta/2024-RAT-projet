### Ultimate SpartaRAT C# Project
# Info
This RAT project made for fun, I work on updates often.
I started with this project because I had so many ideas, with code I can be creative. This project is still under work, I will add alot more features.
I update this project very often.

**I will greatly appreciate all those who could invest their time in PR (Pull Request) or CR (Code Review) my project**

# Why SpartaRAT is better than the others?
- Windows defender full bypass using Exclude list and more AV Bypass techniques.
- Windows defender Exclude list bypass (app not showing at windows defender GUI whitelist while it is).
- Persistence (using task scheduler).
- .NET Framework, tested at the latest windows 11, 10, 8.1 versions.
- Open source & Easy to contact the developer
- Really well written code

  **This is the beginning of the project, alot more stuff will be added soon.**
