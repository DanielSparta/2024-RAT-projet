### Ultimate SpartaRAT C# Project
This project is still under work, I will add alot more features.
I update this project very often.

Legacy version of SpartaRAT (https://github.com/DanielSparta/RAT-Project-2022) - Created in 2022, with very bad code.

# Why my RAT is better than the others?
- Windows defender full bypass using Exclude list and more AV Bypass techniques.
- Windows defender Exclude list bypass (app not showing at windows defender GUI whitelist while it is).
- Persistence (using task scheduler).
- .NET Framework, tested at the latest windows 11, 10, 8 versions.
- Open source & Easy to contact the developer
- Really well written code

# Info
This RAT project made for fun, I work on updates often.
I started with this project because I had so many ideas, with code I can be creative.
