### Ultimate SpartaRAT C# Project
# Info
This RAT project made for fun, I work on updates often.
I started with this project because I had so many ideas, with code I can be creative. This project is still under work, I will add alot more features.
I update this project very often.

**I will greatly appreciate all those who could invest their time in PR (Pull Request) or CR (Code Review) my project.**

**This project is created for educational purposes only and does not support any illegal activity**

# Why SpartaRAT is better than the others?
- Home made code - I am the one who write almost all the code, not ChatGPT or forums
- Anti Virus bypass - True for today there is no anti virus that detects my program
- Persistence (using task scheduler)
- .NET Framework - tested at the latest windows 11, 10, 8.1 versions
- Open source & Easy to contact the developer
- Really well written code, easy and fun to read, learn, or debugging

  **This is the beginning of the project, alot more stuff will be added soon.**
